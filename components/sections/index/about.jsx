Outside of work, I enjoy attending Phaneroo services, praying in tongues and listening to sermons. My active life is spent around books and poems, I read, write and journal my thoughts. I also run a twitter space(monthly) for poetry's sake. I am confident in my ability to play chess, scrabble, rugby and any game that involves brains and adrenaline."

To many people in the outside world, it's a third world country, but to me it is a training ground, I have lived in Kampala( our capital City ) for the past 4 years and I think If you can survive in Kampala, you can survive anywhere in the Universe(except the sun..) It has taught me to network, value relationships and cultivate intentional ones; to be diligent and snappy with work and always deliver results. It has also taught me to be frugal with what I have, to live life always on the edge and to ensure that I always give back when I get to a high place in life."
