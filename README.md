## Updates
#### Dev Update â€” October 6th till Date, 2023 ðŸ¥°
I relocated to a beautiful neighbourhood in the suburbs of Accra, Ghana. There has been a LOT of work getting to explore, acclimatize, and map the area to know the people, places and hidden treasures it holds. I am hoping to resume serious development in the next month when capstone starts!

On a really interesting note, I have met many wonderful people in my cohort(Class of 2024) who have given me a rich view into what Africa has to offer as a continent in terms of skill and talent!

## Please fork this repo! ðŸ¦„

Fork, Install, Editing, and Deploy instructions coming soon(verrrryyy soon)!

This is an open-source template, and it was also a great oppoortunity for me to learn! 

It is my hope that by sharing this project it can give others a chance to enjoy learning Nextjs (and have as much fun as I did), and hopefully brings value to people as a portfolio and networking tool!
